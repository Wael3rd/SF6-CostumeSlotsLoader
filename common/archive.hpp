// Archive extraction for the costume loader: .zip, .7z and .rar (RAR4 and RAR5).
//
// Runs inside DllMain, like the rest of the loader, so every decoder here is single-threaded
// and never loads a library at runtime: zip through miniz, 7z through the LZMA SDK decoder,
// rar through UnRAR built with SF6_LOADER_NO_SMP and SF6_LOADER_NO_CRYPT32 (see
// third_party/unrar/SF6_PATCHES.txt).
//
// The format is recognised by its signature, never by its extension.
