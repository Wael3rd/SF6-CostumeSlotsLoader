# Changelog

## 1.9.0 (2026-09-30)

### Changed
- **No more Lua scripts.** Everything in game is done by the native plugin `SF6_CostumeSlotsNative.dll`: the
  costume menus, ownership, colours and select screen data, the online alias, the stage select screen and the
  VS screen. It is driven by the game's own events (a menu shown or closed, an outfit folder mounted, the stage
  select screen shown, UP / DOWN) instead of looking at the game every frame: during a fight it does nothing.
  An outfit mount is seen when the game creates the outfit's visual manifest; the online alias then checks
  for two seconds, during the loading screen, and stops. Played online on 2026-09-30.
  An update made by hand leaves the old scripts in `reframework/autorun/`: the plugin renames them to
  `.lua.old`.
- The loader's stage watcher sleeps until the stage choice file changes (a change notification) instead of
  looking at it four times a second, and the stage redirection no longer counts the files it sees.

### Added
- **Stage slots (experimental).** Stage mods dropped as downloaded in `reframework/stage_mods/` (`.zip`,
  `.7z`, `.rar`, a folder with a `natives` tree, a `.pak`) become variants of the stage they change. On the
  stage select screen of Fighting Ground > Versus, UP / DOWN cycles a stage through its original look and
  each mod; the name and a preview made from the mod's screenshot follow, the VS screen shows the choice, the
  battle loads it, and the choice is kept per stage. A pack covering many stages gives one variant per stage
  and option. The mod files go into a patch pak of their own, below the costume pak, and are served in place
  of the original files only while selected, through one hook on the engine's path hashing that is installed
  only once a variant is selected. The choice is local and applies to every load of the stage, online too;
  online play has not been tested. Details and limits: [stages/README.md](stages/README.md).
- `SF6_CostumeLoader.log` names every file of a mod that its slot does not show
  (`WARN: the slot loads ... from the game`): what to send when a part of a mod is missing.

### Repository
- **Renamed SF6-SlotsLoader** (was SF6-CostumeSlotsLoader; the old links lead here). It now also holds the
  stage slots (`stages/`): on the stage select screen, UP / DOWN cycles a stage through its mods. They ship in
  the same `amd_ags_x64.dll` (experimental, see *Added*). Layout: `costumes/`,
  `stages/`, `common/` (pak and archive code, third party), `proxy/`, one `build.bat` at the root that builds
  everything into `build/`, including the costume loader alone (`build/costumes_only/`) for the releases.

### Fixed
- **The stage slots' pak is not taken for a mod pak.** It sits right below the costume pak; adding or removing
  a stage mod rebuilt the costume pak (about 50 s with many mods). It is now recognised by its marker and left
  out, the costume pak stays above it, and when only its presence changed the costume pak is moved instead of
  rebuilt. The first launch after updating rebuilds the costumes once.
- `outfits.json` (read by the audit) follows the costume pak when it changes number.
- **A mod's own Havok cloth is used by its slot.** A slot kept the game's cloth file of the original outfit on
  the mod's body (Lily Kenyan Summer C2); it now gets its own copy pointing at the mod's cloth, as for chain
  physics. The model folder's havok references are no longer renamed into files that exist nowhere.
- **Weapons show on the character select screen.** The slot's weapon list was loaded late: the first player to
  pick the outfit had no weapons there (Lily Kenyan Summer C2). Both of the scene's references now point at the
  slot's list.
- **Parts a mod retextures without their material are shown.** A material of the outfit that the mod does not
  ship, but that uses textures the mod ships, kept the game's textures: C. Viper Lace lingerie C2's head,
  the hood of Lily Haruka Hoodie (her hair material uses the body's cloth), Oni Juri's eyes (shared `000/`
  folder). The slot now gets its own copy of that material, bound to the mod's textures. The mod's files stay
  out of the original outfit, which stays as the game made it.
- **A mod's wind settings are used by its slot** (`weather/wind/.../*_chain_BattleSetting.chain`: Swimsuit
  C. Viper, C. Viper Concept Outfit). The scene now follows every file the slot has under its own name.
- **The DLC paks are read.** The game reads them over `re_chunk_000.pak`, for the players who own them: they
  hold newer colour files of the Outfit 1 of JP, Dhalsim, Lily and Guile. The slots were built from the older
  ones; they are now built from what the game reads, and buying or removing a DLC rebuilds them.

## 1.8.1 (2026-09-30)

Found by testing with a large set of Cammy, C. Viper and Ingrid mods installed together.

### Fixed
- **A slot no longer takes files from another mod.** The colour files and the colour-variation data a mod does
  not ship, and the high-resolution (streaming) version of a texture, were looked up among the files of all
  installed mods. Several mods ship textures of the same name for the same outfit (five for Cammy's Outfit 1),
  so an outfit got the colours or the pictures of another one, and which one depended on the other mods
  installed: Escape from Shadaloo lost its green, Alt Bare Legs its jacket and glove colours. A slot now uses
  its own mod's files, else the game's, as when the mod is installed alone.
- **Texture references written with doubled slashes (`002/01//Knit_CMASK.tex`) or backslashes
  (`product\model\...`)** now follow the texture to its slot. Before, the outfit waited forever for a texture
  that had moved (Camo Cammy showed the original outfit, then froze; C. Viper Trench Coat froze the select
  screen).
- **Files placed directly in `product/model/`** (Dance Outfit for Cammy names a `1.tex` there) are taken from
  folder mods; the game keeps none there, so nothing can be overridden.
- **Material files made for an older layout** are rebuilt on the game's file for that part: when every
  material has the game's name and master material but exactly the parameters the game had minus those it
  gained since, the game's file is used, with the mod's texture bindings, rendering flags and parameter
  values (Dance Outfit for Cammy showed a dark body and opaque fabric; it shows the sheer dancer). Measured on
  41 material files of a large collection: only that one matches.
- **A part hidden on purpose stays hidden.** A mod that hides a face or hair with a reduced mesh naming a
  material no file defines (AoD replace Ingrid) no longer gets the original part back, and such an outfit is
  no longer left out.
- **A partial add-on brings its parts to a costume put in the same sub-folder**, even when it was made for
  another outfit's folder (BellyHair for Dance Outfit: hair in Outfit 1's folder, costume of Outfit 2). Only the
  combined outfit is made when both are in one sub-folder of the character; archive bundles keep the base and
  each variant. Note: Ken SFV with Ken SFV Hair in one sub-folder now gives only the combined outfit.

### Script
- The script does nothing while a fight is running (match, replay, training outside the pause) when the
  native plugin is there. The signal is the fight clock (`gBattle.Game.stage_timer`) moving; it stops in
  pause, menus and loading, and the checks come back at once. Before, the save, the costume ownership and
  the colour clean-up were polled every frame, about 3 fps on a CPU-bound laptop during a replay; now 8 us
  per frame. Never while the Battle Settings menu is open (its closing must be handled), and without the
  native plugin the script keeps its in-match role.

## 1.8.0 (2026-09-29)

- A part the mod made for an older layout of the game is taken over when the outfit's scene takes that part
  from another costume's folder (Aria for Ingrid: face and hair). The slot gets the mod's part with the
  original material file of the place it replaces; a material the part names that no file defines is
  reported in the log and kept as the mod made it. To confirm in game.
- A mod with a real costume (ten files or more) and a minor entry next to it (two files or less, no
  texture) no longer gives that entry as an outfit (Athena for Ingrid gave a second, almost original
  Drive Tech outfit).
- Other slots are unchanged.

## 1.7.0 (2026-09-29)

### Colour swatches (experimental)
- The two squares shown next to each colour in the costume menu are computed for every modded outfit: the
  tints of its two largest colour zones, from the mod's own colour files and colour masks, instead of the
  original outfit's squares. Capcom picks its squares by hand, so the result looks like the outfit without
  matching what Capcom would have chosen. This is a trial and may be removed. Outfits whose materials do
  not use the game's colour system keep the original squares.

### Compatibility
- A mod that ships its own costume scene and points a part at another folder gets that part: Mummy Dhalsim
  showed the original head. Followed only when the file exists and the mod's scene matches the game's
  (same model references, same path length); otherwise the log says it was not followed.
- Textures whose small mip levels were sized with fractional blocks are repaired as a whole (Feixue for
  Mai lost its body and face). The mip table is rewritten only when the one computed from the format
  fills the file exactly.
- A part hidden behind a stripped mesh of another part keeps that mesh, paired with a material file that
  defines its materials, instead of getting the original part back (Mai's hair on Feixue and SuiSui) or
  being left out (Changli).
- Physics files kept next to the parts, where the game keeps them, are followed: the slot's physics
  settings point at the mod's files (Chique Casual Ingrid's hair). Every mod laid out that way now uses its
  own physics.

### Building
- `build.bat` finds Visual Studio or the Build Tools wherever they are installed.
- `loader/third_party/bcdec.h` (MIT or public domain) decodes the colour masks.

## 1.6.1 (2026-09-27)

- `reframework\costume_mods\SF6_CostumeAudit.bat`: lists what is installed (loader, REFramework, script,
  plugin), what the last launch did, the costume mods found with where they come from (Fluffy pak,
  archive, folder) and the outfits each one gave. Read-only; the report is saved next to it.
- The loader writes `reframework\data\SF6_Costumes_Data\outfits.json` at each generation, the list the
  audit reads.
- Notes or other files dropped in `costume_mods` no longer make the next launch rebuild everything; only
  archives, `.pak` files and folders count.
- A mod without a name in its `modinfo.ini` is named after its archive or folder in the log.
- Documented: a costume and an add-on from two archives are combined when put in one sub-folder of the
  character.

## 1.6.0 (2026-09-27)

### Installing mods
- Costume mods are read as downloaded: `.zip`, `.7z` and `.rar` files in
  `reframework\costume_mods\<Character>\`, unpacked once into a hidden cache.
- Bundles give one outfit slot per option; add-ons (no gloves, other hair, a weapon) are combined with
  the outfit they complete: up to three add-ons, one variant each, plus one with all of them when they
  do not replace the same files.
- Identical files shared by several variants are stored once in the generated pak.

### Mods made for older versions of the game
- Colour files whose type signature predates a game update are brought up to date
  (DOA4 Christie, TFD Racer showed up white).
- Colour files in the 2023 layout are converted to the current one (Ken SFV style).
- Textures whose mip table declares a wrong row pitch are repaired (Vegeta Majin).
- Material references are renamed together with the textures they point at (white Specter Zangief).
- A part shipped without a material gets the original material of that part only (see-through Lily).
- Weapons and props listed in `model_parts` follow the slot (Lily's clubs).
- A model folder shared by two outfits is mapped to the right one (Mummy Dhalsim).

### Loading safety
- Every slot is read back the way the game will load it before the pak is written: files present,
  every mesh material defined by its material file, every texture present and consistent. Broken parts
  are rebuilt from the mod's shared part or the original outfit; a slot that still fails is left out
  and named in the log.
- Files only a mod has, stored in another outfit's folder, are kept (Juri stalled with two mods).
- Only the slots in use are declared to the game (a character on trial listed 100 empty outfits).
- The pak is really written or nothing changes: a game still closing no longer leaves an old pak
  marked up to date.
- Removing a mod no longer stalls the character select: every unused slot number shows the
  character's Outfit 1, for a choice saved by the game or a replay that still names it.

### Modular mods and variants
- Modular mods built for Fluffy are installed the way Fluffy does by default: one outfit per shape
  option, first texture option, optional parts left out (C. Viper went from 134 entries to 18).
- Options that replace the same files no longer share a slot; identical outfits are installed once.
- A character that runs out of its 100 slots is named in the log.
- A mod that only changes a part of an original outfit (glasses, earrings) gives that outfit with
  the change, in a slot of its own, instead of being ignored.

### Names
- Outfit names follow each other per character (Outfit I, II, III) after a mod is removed; each slot
  keeps its number behind the name, so saved choices and replays stay valid.

### Log
- Each slot line shows its outfit name (BrewedVFX).
